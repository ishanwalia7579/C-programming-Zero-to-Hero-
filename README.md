## 📝 Overview

The program efficiently calculates the discounted prices of items using a **monotonic stack** approach. It processes the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring a time complexity of **O(n)**.

### Problem Description:
1. For each item in the array, find the **next smaller or equal price**.
2. Subtract this price from the current price to apply the discount.
3. If no such smaller price exists, the price remains unchanged.
